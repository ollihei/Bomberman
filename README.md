# Bomberman
UI
Building a Bomberman game in which the players create UI's that are fighting together is a long time dream of mine. For some reason I have never really spent time to build such game until now. In this Git repo I will be building such game.

I think it's not important to get the game done. It's more important to enjoy building it and learning new.

## About the implementation

BombermanUI build on TypeScript. The (human) players build UI's on JavaScript. The server on which the UI's keep on fighting will be build on Node and Express. Everyting is in Docker container and there should be Jasmine tests.
