# BombermanUI

Building a Bomberman game in which the players create UI's that are fighting together is a long time dream of mine. For some reason I have never really spent time to build such game until now. In this Git repo I will be building the game of my dreams.

In project I think it's not important to get the job done. It's more important to enjoy building it and learning new.

## About the implementation

BombermanUI is build on TypeScript. The (human) players build UI's on JavaScript. The server on which the UI's keep on fighting will be build on Node and using Express. Everyting is in Docker container and there should be Jasmine tests.
